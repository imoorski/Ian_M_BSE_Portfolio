# Midi Controller
For this project, I built an Arduino MIDI Controller. A MIDI controller is a tool that allows for the interactive creation of music. I chose to make this project because I really enjoy making music and I wanted to build something I could use in a meaningful way.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was building a basic circuit and getting the Arduino Uno set up with the Ableton digital audio workstation. The circuit includes two potentiameters that are connected to two of the analog pins on the Arduino. I used the standard Firmata code in the Arduino IDE to get it to connect with Ableton. Ableton has a plugin specifically designed for Arduino, so it was very straightforward once they were connected. I created a simple midi synth instrument in Ableton and mapped the two analog pins to different parameters of the synth. This allowed me to control the synth parameters with the potentiameters. Initially, I was trying to connect the Arduino with the Logic Pro X digital audio workstation, but I had a lot of difficulties with that. After some research, I found out that Ableton is actually much more compatible and optimized for the Arduino, so I switched over. For this milestone, I also created a diagram plan for my midi controller.
